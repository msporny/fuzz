  <h1>Mark Birbeck</h1>
  <div about="#mark" instanceof="foaf:Person">
<p><span property="foaf:name">Mark Birbeck</span> has spent the last 7 years designing, building and thinking about a framework that enables dynamic user interfaces, driven by data content. Such a framework can dramatically increase programming productivity, and open up the world of application-building to many more people. Since he believes that the framework should be built on open standards, <a rel="foaf:depiction" href="http://xhtml.com/8D79838D-7654-4400-AE85-FF810E1ABDD7/birbeck.jpg">Mark</a> is heavily involved in the W3C, as an invited expert with the XForms and XHTML 2 Working Groups, and also as the designer of RDFa.</p>

<p>His companies created the formsPlayer XForms processor, and Sidewinder, an open source, next-generation semantic web browser.</p>

<p>His blog focuses on building a new generation of internet applications, and a number of entries relate to Ajax, XForms, the semantic web, and the use of declarative mark-up.</p>

  <h1>Manu Sporny</h1>
  <div about="#manu" instanceof="foaf:Person">
<span property="foaf:name">Manu Sporny</span> founded and was appointed CEO of Digital Bazaar in 2004. The company is based in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. <a rel="foaf:depiction" href="http://www.zenmachine.org/pix/manu_tophat.jpg">He</a> started his career as a serial entrepreneur performing research at Virginia Tech in the late 90s in information visualization, virtual reality and high-performance graphics technologies. After graduating from Virginia Tech with a degree in Computer Science, he founded xRhino, a company specializing in software tools and middleware for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game platform. xRhino was successfully sold in late 2003 to Advanced Simulation Technology, a Department of Defense contractor.
</p>
<p>
Sporny then focused his attention on solving the problem of legalizing peer-to-peer digital content distribution online, allowing distributed groups of people to legally buy and sell digital music, film, and print content via the Internet.
</p>

<p>
In addition to his duties at Digital Bazaar, Sporny is an Invited Expert to the World Wide Web Consortium, chartered to work on creating semantic web technologies that will enable computers to utilize rich information on websites and eventually learn about their environment. He is the primary designer of Internet Microformat standards to embed meta-information about audio and video into web pages. He has authored several patents and sits on various technology company advisory boards.
</p>
<p>
Sporny's favorite past-time is watching talented people realize their full potential. He believes in the goodness of people and the hope that humanity will continue to improve the quality of life around the globe. He believes <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/92">things are getting better</a>.
